# 2D_Array_in_cpp

Aim : To study and implement operations on 2D arrays (matrices) in C++.

Tools: VS Code

# Theory:

A two-dimensional array (2D array) in C++ is a collection of elements stored in rows and columns, like a table or matrix. It is used to represent mathematical matrices or tabular data.

Matrix operations are fundamental in many areas such as graphics, engineering, data processing, and numerical computations. In C++, we can use nested loops to perform operations like:

# Matrix Input & Display
Taking values for each row and column using nested loops.

Displaying matrix in matrix form using cout.

# Matrix Addition
Each element of matrix A is added to the corresponding element of matrix B.

`C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j]`

# Matrix Multiplication
Row of A is multiplied with column of B:

`C[i][j] = sum(A[i][k] * B[k][j])`

# Diagonal Addition
Sum of elements from top-left to bottom-right:

`Sum = A[0][0] + A[1][1] + A[2][2] + ...`

# Transpose
Converting rows to columns:

`Transpose[i][j] = A[j][i]`

# Comparison of Rows
Element-wise comparison between first and second row:

`if(A[0][j] == A[1][j])`

# 1. Matrix Input & Display 

Algorithm:

Start
2.Input number of rows and columns

Use nested loop to input each element of matrix

Use another nested loop to display the matrix

5.End

ðŸ”´ 2. Addition of Two Matrices â€“ Algorithm:

Start
2 Input number of rows and columne

3.Input elements of Matrix A

Input elements of Matrix B
5 For each element, add A[i][j] + B[i][j]

6.Store result in a third matrix C[i][j]

7.Display matrix

8.End

ðŸ”´ 3. Multiplication of Two Matrices â€“ Algorithm:

Start

Input number of rows and columns

Input elements of Matrix A

4.Input elements of Matrix B

5.Initialize result matrix C[i][j] = 0

6.Use 3 nested loops:

â€ƒâ€ƒðŸ”¸ Outer loop: for each row of A

â€ƒâ€ƒðŸ”¸ Middle loop: for each column of B

â€ƒâ€ƒðŸ”¸ Inner loop: multiply A[i][k] * B[k][j] and add to C[i][j]

Display matrix C
End
ðŸ”´ 4. Diagonal Addition â€“ Algorithm:

Start
2.Input size n of square matrix

3.Input matrix elements

Initialize sum = 0

Use loop: for i = 0 to n-1, add A[i][i] to sum

Display the sum

End

 5. Transpose of a Matrix â€“ Algorithm:

Start
2.Input rows and columns

3.Input elements of matrix

4.Use nested loop:

â€ƒâ€ƒðŸ”¸ Outer loop for i = 0 to column

â€ƒâ€ƒðŸ”¸ Inner loop for j = 0 to row

â€ƒâ€ƒðŸ”¸ Print A[j][i] instead of A[i][j]

End
ðŸ”´ 6. Compare First and Second Row â€“ Algorithm:

Start

Input number of rows and columns

Make sure there are at least 2 rows

Input matrix A

Use a loop to compare A[0][j] and A[1][j] for each column

6.If equal, print "Equal", else "Not Equal"

End

# Conclusion:

In this experiment, We performed matrix input, display, addition, multiplication, diagonal sum, transpose, and row comparison using nested loops and 2D arrays. This helped us understand how to use two-dimensional arrays effectively for mathematical and data-based operations. We also learned the logic behind row-column traversal, element-wise operations, and condition checking in matrices. The experiment enhanced our logical thinking and improved our C++ programming skills for real-life matrix problems.
